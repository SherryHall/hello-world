    <h1>Thoughts on the Web</h1>
    <p>
        <span class="accent-it">At the start</span>, the web was considered just a toy for computer geeks. Most people did not see it as something that would have any relevance to them and their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="accent-it">Now</span>, the web is an essential part of most people lives. People who were once isolated due to age or health have a means to connect and socialize, greatly increasing their quality of life. <span class="accent-it">In the future</span>, employees will no longer have assigned desks. They will simply log in where ever they are, and their information and resources will come to them, resulting in significant savings.
